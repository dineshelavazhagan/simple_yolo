## Model and Classes

*   The code uses ultralytics YOLO (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`) by default.
*   `coco.txt` contains class names for the COCO dataset.
*   Adjust the classes and filters in `script.js` and `index.html` as needed.

## Notes on Development Process

### Initial Work:

*   Implemented the backend detection logic using YOLO, leveraging prior project experience.
*   Set up the Docker environment and the initial Flask frontend with an upload button, following references from Flask and YOLO documentation.

### Subsequent Enhancements with LLMs:

*   After completing the core functionality (running detection, returning JSON, and a basic frontend to upload images), a Large Language Model (LLM) was used as an assistant to refine the user interface and code structure.
*   The LLM helped in:
    *   Improving the frontend layout and controls.
    *   Adding dynamic toggling of bounding boxes, labels, confidence slider, and class filters.
    *   Providing a cleaner, more extensible codebase and a better user experience.
*   The LLM was used after the initial solution was working, as a means to perfect and polish the final deliverable.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple but complete microservice-based object detection solution using Docker, Flask, FastAPI, and YOLO. It can serve as a template or starting point for more complex object detection systems.
